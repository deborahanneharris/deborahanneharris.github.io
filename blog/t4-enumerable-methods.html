  <h1>Enumerable#cycle</h1>

      My assignment this week was to select a Ruby Enumerable method. I chose Enumerable#cycle. I am still quite a novice at understanding the Ruby language but will do my best to explain this concept.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent significant time online attempting to find real world applications of Ruby cycle. I didn't find an indepth explanation in either of our current Ruby texts. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find a good example to use in my explanation.

      To understand what cycle will do here is the following example from Ruby-Docs:
      <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><div style="background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;border:solid gray;border-width:.1em .1em .1em .8em;padding:.2em .6em;"><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%">a = [<span style="color: #aa5500">&quot;a&quot;</span>, <span style="color: #aa5500">&quot;b&quot;</span>, <span style="color: #aa5500">&quot;c&quot;</span>]
  a.cycle { |x| <span style="color: #00aaaa">puts</span> x }  <span style="color: #aaaaaa; font-style: italic"># print, a, b, c, a, b, c,.. forever.</span>
  a.cycle(<span style="color: #009999">2</span>) { |x| <span style="color: #00aaaa">puts</span> x }  <span style="color: #aaaaaa; font-style: italic"># print, a, b, c, a, b, c.</span>
</pre></div></p>
      <p>
      Essentially cycle allows the program to cycle over the data in the array and return it in one of three ways:
      1. If there is not a set times for cycling through it will repeat infinitely.
      2. It will cycle for a set amount of times if indicated.
      3. If a non-positive number (-1, -2, etc.) is given or the collection is empty, it does nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
      There is main problem that I identified from my research with the cycle method. The argument to #cycle specifies the number of times to cycle, but NOT the number of elements to cycle through. It doesn't seem to be a process that is very popular for regular usage on it's own. It seems to be combined with other Enumerables.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fun fact: #reverse_cycle doesn't exist. To reverse your cycle reverse_each.cycle is the proper command.
    </p>
    <p>
      In conclusion, passing an argument to cycle will completely go through the collection that many times. If no argument is passed, it goes infinitely (producing an infinite loop).
