    <p>
      There are actually four types of positioning your elements in a webpage. The first position is static. Static is the normal flow on a basic website. Each block of text/images sits on top of the next one. A CSS property is not necessary to indicate this position.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then second position is called relative. This moves an element of text/images in relationship to where it would have been in the normal static flow. For example, you can have an indent on one of the elements to draw attention to it compared to the other elements in the static flow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third position is absolute which means the block of text/images is taken out of the normal/static flow and no longer affects the position of the other elements on the page. The static elements act as though it doesn’t exist. The designer needs to watch the width of the static elements so they don’t override the absolute image.
    </p>
    <p>
      The final position is fixed which keeps the fixed element always in the same position relative to the browser window. When a user scrolls down the webpage the fixed element stays in the exact same place at all times. In this case the designer also needs to be aware of the elements that remain in the normal flow in regards to the margin-top. Since there is a fixed element the margin-top will need to allow for this element so the reader will be able to see the text at the very top of the page.
