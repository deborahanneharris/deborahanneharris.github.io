  <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
  <h2>Women are from Venus?</h2>
  <h4>August 16, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      In my previous work with students at risk I can definitely affirm that stereotype threat exists. This threat is defined as a group member feeling that they already have a negative stereotype in certain settings for poor performance. Most of the research on this topic seems to relate to poor performance in an academic setting.

      As a woman who was "good enough" at math and science I never felt that I was encouraged to explore career paths associated with these fields. In hindsight, I did my own daughters a disservice by not encouraging their efforts in STEM but followed the default setting of the humanities.
    </p>
    <p>
       When I was taking the advanced math courses in high school I was the only girl in the group. I was the only girl on the math team. I even sacrificed my "first chair" status in band to take math classes. Math wasn't something that I had an overwhelming joy performing but I was proficient. At that time, encouraging young women to explore STEM careers was simply not done. Most of my friends in college were there to get their MRS degree. I ended up studying political science and that ended my regular interactions with math and science.

       Interestingly enough, I have experienced negative interactions with other men outside of DBC in the software world who tell me "software is too hard for you to understand". I think that women in this field have a lot of work to do in this industry especially with the over 40 crowd before we will be accepted. I believe that I will have to work extra hard to be taken seriously as a programmer.

       I think that the answer to this issue is to encourage the growth mindset in ourselves and others. Employers especially need to be made aware of stereotype threat and how it may muddle a person's performance in hiring interviews. Believing that the mind is malleable and that one segment of the demographic doesn't own a certain ability is what educators, parents and progressive employers should pursue.
