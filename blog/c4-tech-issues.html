  <h1>Derivative Trading in Tech Stocks</h1>
  <h2>Why are so many hot tech companies not going public?</h2>
  <h4>July 11, 2015</h4>

  <section>
  <h3>Privately held tech stocks are being traded behind closed doors.</h3>
   <h4>Is this an issue that web developers should be concerned about?</h4>
  <p>“No one knows the exact size of the so-called secondary market for shares of private companies that are held by employees and other investors. Participants in pre-IPO trading estimate that $10 billion to $30 billion in stock changed hands last year,” said the Wall Street Journal in a March 27, 2015 article. <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-wall-street-middlemen-help-silicon-valley-employees-cash-in-early-1427474284">How Wall Street Middlemen Help Silicon Valley Employees Cash In Early</a>
  </p>
    <p>
      A large market for private sales of private tech company stocks has developed in recent years. This surge is in response to several factors.
    </p>
  <p>First, there is another tech boom in the works similar to the tech bubble of the late 1990s. Second, since the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 the cost is dramatically higher for private companies to “go public” in a stock exchange. The recent surge in highly valued startups and the difficulty of liquidating an initial investment in the startup has lead to billions of dollars in private sales which then allows early investors and employees of closely-held private companies to monetize their stock holdings.
  </p>
<h4>What are some issues with these largely unregulated sales?</h4>

<p>This is an extremely risky situation for sellers and buyers since they are trading derivatives that aren't properly valued through a public venue, i.e. national stock exchange.</p>
<p>Sometimes, middlemen offering the private startup shares don’t exactly own the shares and frequently misrepresent their situation to investors. Such activities are liable to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fines.</p>
<p>Legally these sales are in a grey area at best due to the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 which makes it unlawful for most individual investors to trade stock swaps unless the transaction takes place on a national securities exchange with a registration statement from the SEC. Stock swaps are contracts in which two parties agree to exchange payments based partly on the value of private companies.</p>
    <p>In addition, it appears that most startup companies have rules for employees that either prohibit the sale of their stock or require their prior approval. Apparently some middlemen have figured out how to get around those restrictions, including deals that enable employees to get cash without actually selling their stock. The middleman of a transaction can arrange for the employee to make a pledge/promise in which the shares are used as collateral for a cash payment to the employee. When the private tech firm eventually has an Initial Public Offering (IPO) or another liquidity event, the employee must allow the sale of their pledged shares to go to the investor via the middleman.</p>
     <h4> Repercussions for the tech community:</h4>

<p>Some closely held tech companies facilitate these sales so their employees may “cash out” their investment since the company isn’t publicly traded and has no plans to offer an IPO in the near future. Is this a sound policy? I can understand that if I was an employee of a successful startup I would want the opportunity to take a portion of my stock and diversify into other investment vehicles. But would I want to risk a possible SEC fine?</p>
<p>Since the trading is far less transparent than the previous tech boom in the late 1990’s who will really be harmed if these valuations are eventually proved to be wildly inflated? I believe that there will be less harm to the average investor since they don’t have access to these trades; I wonder if the “sophisticated” investors that are making these trades will run crying to the SEC for help if this all goes south?</p>
<p>What about the employees who have “sold the rights’ to their stock? Will they relinquish the right to their pledged stock when it eventually goes public? What if the startup fails, will the investors who paid for the pledged stock then sue the employees for a refund if the company implodes? These questions will keep the lawyers busy when the inevitable tech stock bust becomes a reality.</p>
<h4>The SEC will have the final say on this matter.</h4>
<p>According to the Wall Street Journal, July 5, 2015, “Securities regulators have launched a broad investigation into whether hedge funds and other investors are improperly selling hot private technology stocks amid a boom in the trading of such shares, people close to the probe say.”<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/regulators-probe-marketing-of-hot-private-tech-shares-1436139252?cb=logged0.7565521758515388">Regulators Probe Marketing of Hot Private Tech Shares</a></p>
