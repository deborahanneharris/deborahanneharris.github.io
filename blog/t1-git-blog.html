      Version Control is a method that records all changes to computer files so that they can be recalled at will at a later time. It is a great safety feature since if you make a mistake you can easily recover previous versions.
    </p>
      <p>
      Git tracks all the versions of your coding. All versions are saved and you can reproduce the contents of your files exactly as you originally saved them.
    </p>

      GitHub is an example of a Distributed Version Control System that has the entire repository of all the work. If a server dies all repositories can be sent back up to the server to restore it.
