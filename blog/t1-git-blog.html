      Version Control is a method that records all changes to computer files so that they can be recalled at will at a later time. It is a great safety feature since if you make a mistake you can easily recover previous versions.

        Git tracks all the versions of your coding. All versions are saved and you can reproduce the contents of your files exactly as you originally saved them.

        GitHub is an example of a Distributed Version Control System that has the entire repository of all the work. If a server dies all repositories can be sent back up to the server to restore it.
