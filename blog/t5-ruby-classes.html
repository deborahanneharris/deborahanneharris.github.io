  <h1>Ruby Classes</h1>
  <h2>Where are the Grandkids?</h2>
  <h4>July 18, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      I had a brain infarction and couldn’t think of a “real world object” to use as an example of “Class”.  Then my friend Jennifer Poeng suggested that I read <a href="http://www.eriktrautman.com/posts/ruby-explained-classes">Erik Trautman’s</a> article about classes.
      </p>
      <p>
      His use of Vikings as a class inspired me to think of my five (and counting) grandchildren.
      <p>
      The “class” method is a way to organize data among various different methods. I have set up a class named Grandchildren. My grandchildren have many different attributes to record but they all share the same basic information. I was interested in tracking their Full Name, Sex, Date of Birth, Favorite Activity, Favorite Food so I could keep track of their birthdays, potential recreational activities and seasonal gifting opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
      First, we would name the class Grandchildren and then #initialize the data that we want to track about my Grandchildren class (Full Name, Sex, Date of Birth, Favorite Activity, Favorite Food).
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, we will set up individual instance variables that all class Grandchildren share but they have different values per individual. For example: “Mark Darrell Harris” has a different Full Name instance variable value than “Derek Oscar Fuchs” but they BOTH have a Full Name variable.
        <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><div style="background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;border:solid gray;border-width:.1em .1em .1em .8em;padding:.2em .6em;"><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #0000aa">class</span> <span style="color: #00aa00; text-decoration: underline">Grandchildren</span>
  <span style="color: #0000aa">def</span> <span style="color: #00aa00">initialize</span>(full_name, sex, date_of_birth, favorite_activity, favorite_food)
    <span style="color: #aa0000">@full_name</span> = full_name
    <span style="color: #aa0000">@sex</span> = sex
    <span style="color: #aa0000">@date_of_birth</span> = date_of_birth
    <span style="color: #aa0000">@favorite_activity</span> = favorite_activity
    <span style="color: #aa0000">@favorite_food</span> = favorite_food
  <span style="color: #0000aa">end</span>
<span style="color: #0000aa">end</span>
</pre></div>
      </p>

      <p>
        Now how would an instance method apply to this example? What kind of activities or methods could we have class Grandchildren do?
      </p>
        <p>
          We could define a method for birthday party and list the appropriate instance variables. Since these methods are being called or used by class Grandchildren they are called instance methods.
          <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><div style="background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;border:solid gray;border-width:.1em .1em .1em .8em;padding:.2em .6em;"><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #0000aa">def</span> <span style="color: #00aa00">party</span>(full_name, date_of_birth, favorite_activity, favorite_food)
      <span style="color: #aaaaaa; font-style: italic">#code for party preparations</span>
    <span style="color: #0000aa">end</span>
</pre></div>
        </p>

    <p>
      In conclusion, this was a great topic to incorporate my interest in my grandchildren and also organize their disparate data. As I become more adept at setting up classes I will definitely start tracking my grandchildren in this manner. I'll be a #Dev Grandma for my grandkids.
