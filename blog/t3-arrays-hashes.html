  <h1>Ruby:101</h1>
  <h2>Hash vs. Array</h2>
  <h4>June 26, 2015</h4>

      Where do I begin to explain Ruby’s arrays and hashes to the beginner? I am such a novice myself that it seems difficult to conceptualize but I truly hope that through this process I will become more proficient in the subject matter myself!
    </p>
      <p>
      To the best of my understanding arrays and hashes are both collections of objects which one can access using a “key”.They both are used to store and lookup data.  Arrays however only use integers as a key whereas hashes can support any object as a key.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, Arrays can be thought of as a list of data in some kind of order. Arrays present the data in their listed order.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hash is a collection of pairs of information and each pair is made up of a name and a value. The name is called a key and must be unique. The unique key is used to return the value paired to it. In Hash the order isn’t important it is what it is paired with that is of importance.

        Examples:

Array

months = [ “January”, “February”, “March”, etc. ]

Hash

seasons = { “January” => “winter”, “February” => “winter”, “March” => “spring”, etc. }

Here’s a new shortcut that I learned researching this blog:

%w{} allows you to input all the words in an array without the quotes and commas.

months = %w{ January February March }

Some of my favorite websites use ruby on rails as their programming language:

Airbnb

GitHub

Groupon

Hulu

Kickstarter

Lumosity

Whitepages.

      Here are several examples of Ruby code:

      <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><div style="background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;border:solid gray;border-width:.1em .1em .1em .8em;padding:.2em .6em;"><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #007020">print</span> <span style="background-color: #fff0f0">&#39;hello world!&#39;</span>
      </pre></div>

      <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><div style="background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;border:solid gray;border-width:.1em .1em .1em .8em;padding:.2em .6em;"><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #007020">print</span> <span style="background-color: #fff0f0">&#39;I am learning Array and Hash&#39;</span>
      </pre></div>
