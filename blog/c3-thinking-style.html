  <h1>My Thinking Style</h1>
  <h2>Concrete Sequential</h2>
  <h4>June 26, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      I found the following information on a Concrete Sequential thinker online:

        Concrete Sequential: This learner likes:

        §         order
        §         logical sequence
        §         following directions, predictability
        §         getting facts
        They learn best when:
        §         they have a structured environment
        §         they can rely on others to complete this task
        §         are faced with predictable situations
        §         can apply ideas in pragmatic ways
        What's hard for them?
        §           Working in groups
        §           Discussions that seem to have no specific point
        §           Working in an unorganized environment
        §           Following incomplete or unclear directions
        §           Working with unpredictable people
        §           Dealing with abstract ideas
        §           Demands to "use your imagination"
        §           Questions with no right or wrong answers
        </p>
        <p>
        Concrete sequential learners work best when they:

        have an orderly quiet environment.
        "I don't have the radio blasting away while I study."

        know the accepted way of doing things.
        "I'm not volunteering to be the first at anything."

        have exact directions and examples.
        "Let's do it right the first time."

        can be consistent and efficient.
        "Let's get on with it."

        face limited change in predictable situations.
        "I need to know what is happening to me!"

        are given approval for specific work done.
        "I want to know I'm on the right track."

        can apply ideas in a practical hands-on way.
        "If it's not useful, why do it?"

        can answer, "How does it work?"

        are able to trust that others will follow through.
        "I need to count on you to do what you said."

        have guided practice with an organized person.
        "Let me see a good way to work it out."

      My thinking style is not necessarily the best fit for the remote portion of DBC. Since I am lacking direct feedback on my progress I feel like I’m floating in space without a tether. This makes me feel anxious. Also, wanting to be correct and the lack of direct access to exact directions and examples feeds my anxiety. I have to aggressively network with others in my cohort who are more experienced so I am able to move forward with my learning.
      </p>

      <p>
      The biggest struggle for me has been having a health issue and lack of confidence. Since I’ve a Concrete/Abstract learning style the lack of having a regular guide to my learning has shaken my confidence in my ability to do the work. There is very little direct feedback outside of working a PP with a more knowledgable partner. I feel like I’m free floating when I am working on my own since all the material is new to me. I am confident that I will feel better about this issue once I’m onsite since I will have immediate feedback on my learning. Also, the lack of exact directions can make me feel like I’m out of my league with this program. Having all this change in such a short time has also “rocked my world” which is normal for Concrete/Abstract Learners. I do see how coding (once I understand how to do it) will be very attractive to me since it is a very practical hands-on way of solving problems. I also feel hesitant to offer coding solutions since I don’t trust my ability to know the correct way to do it yet. There’s that fear of failure again.

        I will need to continue to reach out to others to PP for immediate feedback and monitor my work environment to keep it free from distractions.

        Overall I would have to say that this has been a much needed “jolt to the system” for me. I am encouraged by my progress over the past few weeks but definitely need to keep up the pressure even during our week break.

        I definitely believe in the growth mindset vs. fixed. However, many people seem to stop trying to learn new things (other than the latest entertainment) after their formal education. I found that reading extensively was how I kept my sanity while my children were small. it enabled me to travel all over the world and through time. I would go to the library and browse the books for different subjects to learn. Sometimes I would try to read most of the books in a certain sub-subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        I firmly believe that my mind is plastic and improving my knowledge and abilities is how one never grows old.
      </p>
      <p>
        As far as DBC is concerned, there is extensive opportunities to have my mind and learning styles stretched since so far it isn’t exactly in my comfort zone for learning. I have to be willing to make mistakes and take chances.
