      I control my own experience by teaching and learning as much as possible. Having a Iâ€™m in the kitchen working and creating not an entitled customer in a restaurant. This is a life-style that is extremely powerful and transformative. Come in to DBC and tear up the code and make mistakes and reassemble it. This is how we learn by rolling up our sleeves and getting dirty. What is your impression of DBC? I have had a very warm impression of the DBC staff. They have been very encouraging and told me I can do it.  How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? I am afraid to make mistakes. My educational experiences were trying to learn what was on the test instead of experimenting and learning more organically. I am very pleased that my children had more of a DBC experience in their education. Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how? Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous? ABSOLUTELY!! The imposter syndrome is something I will definitely struggle with. We all have a lot to learn compared to our teachers who have 20 years experience. Being a great developer is a life time process. This is a very humbling experience. We can all learn from each other and help one another.
