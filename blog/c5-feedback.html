  <h1>Pairing and Giving Feedback</h1>
  <h2>This hurts</h2>
  <h4>July 18, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      This is a very difficult blog to write since it is confirming the concerns that I have about my own abilities to be a successful coder at the rate I need to in order to stay in this program. I have the cultural abilities to work with diverse groups of people but my technical starting point in this program is considerably less than most of the members of my cohort. I almost wish that I had studied intensely for a few months before enrolling! If I had any idea that virtually everyone else had some level of exposure to coding prior to DBC I would have put off my enrollment and worked on my own ahead of time.

      </p>

      <h3>Pairing:</h3>
      <p>
      What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges? I really enjoy the pairing opportunities. Since I am operating at a lower level than most of my pairs it is of value to me. I feel that my contributions aren’t as valued due to my lack of knowledge compared to most members of my cohort.
      Was something particularly fun or rewarding? It is fun to talk and catch up with your partner and share the pain of the day.
      Was something frustrating and difficult for you? The pairing has been positive as long as those who are advanced are willing to work at my pace. I’ve found that some of the time they have already solved the challenge and are ready to cut and paste the solution and move on.
    </p>
      <h3>Feedback:</h3>
      <p>
      How did you feel when you read your feedback? It confirmed what I already knew regarding my technical development. I’m starting at a lower level than my peers and am not catching up as rapidly as I’d like to.
      Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning? Yes, it was very helpful.
      Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair? I need to be more aggressive about driving so that I’m not taking the backseat in the pairing session. Also, exposing my ignorance is unpleasant but very necessary.
      How was it to write feedback? I haven’t had an overly negative experience so it hasn’t been too difficult to complete it.
      What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair? I need to give feedback right away when the experience is still fresh. If I wait too long the sessions tend to run into one another.
      Overall, what do you think of using pairing and feedback to guide your learning? I think that it is a very effective method for students to use for reflection purposes. Again, it is painful to read some of the posts regarding my lackluster technical ability.
