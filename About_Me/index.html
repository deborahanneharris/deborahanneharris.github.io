      I am a long time resident of the greater Chicago area. I enjoy the rich mix of cultures set inside the friendly midwestern temperament. Originally a farmer's daughter from Ohio (OH-IO!), I came up to Chicago to attend college. After my graduation with a political science degree I ended up as a series 7 stockbroker with Merrill Lynch and later Oppenheimer. I specialized in elephant hunting for high net-worth individuals. Shortly afterwards I met my husband who was a floor trader on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Six children followed in ten years with three children married and five grandchildren.  Now I am the prototypical empty-nester looking for my next career path.

          Since 1998 I have been the owner of several successful businesses which were home-based. I was able to keep an eye on my burgeoning brood and gain extensive business operations experience. My first business was a food company and the second was an educational franchise. My husband and I partnered in the educational franchise and had 100-300 employees per school year. I had planned on restarting my food business in early 2014 but a car accident cut those plans short. While I sat and drooled in my living room from my head injury the government funding for our educational franchise dried up. Time for a mid-life crisis! Once I was able to think clearly again I reviewed my <a href="http://careervision.org/">Career Vision</a> profile. Ironically, it listed computer programmer as the best job for me!

          I spent time researching my options for learning computer programming in an efficient manner. <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">Dev Bootcamp</a> seemed to be the best option and after interviewing several 40+ year old DBC alumni I decided that this was the best path for me. However, learning programming has been an excruciating experience. I have been out of an academic environment for a long time so the rigor is daunting. The camaraderie that I have experienced from my fellow cohort members has sustained me through it so far. Maintaining the all important “growth mindset” has been difficult and is a daily battle to maintain it.

          I have many interests that I have developed over the years (besides the most efficient way to change a diaper). I enjoy following the latest financial news through the <a href="http://www.wsj.com/">Wall Street Journal</a> and also geo-political issues. I spent a lot of time Martha Stewart-ing over the years so there aren’t too many hobbies that I haven’t tried at least once. I used to enjoy cooking before I started DBC; now we are eating in a more ad hoc manner which has been disappointing for my husband.

          As far as the DBC tradition of identifying a quirky QUIRK I would have to say that you can find me at my local children's park ghost-riding the toy cars in the sand pit with my grandson! I also have a belly button fetish and take pictures of my grandkids bellies and send them to my family members that are belly button phobic.
